Hey! Welcome to my blog! I'm Mateus, and I'm stoked you're here. Let me give you a quick rundown of who I am and what I'm all about.


## Who am I?

I'm an experienced **Tech Lead** and **Back-End Developer** who's been building cool stuff in the tech world. I love organized and well-architected code and hate when someone messes up the codebase. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading comics and novels, watching YouTube videos, or sleeping to recover my stamina.


## What I Work With

I'm a full-stack kind of developer, but my heart really belongs to the back-end. Here's the tech stack I'm comfortable with:


### Frontend & Frameworks
- **JavaScript** & **TypeScript** - Because type safety is a lifesaver
- **React** & **React Native** - For building beautiful UIs and mobile apps
- **Vite** - Fast builds, happy developer 😄

### Backend & APIs
- **Node.js** - My go-to runtime
- **NestJS** - For building scalable, maintainable APIs

### Databases
I've worked with a bunch of different databases, depending on what the project needs:
- **MySQL** & **MariaDB** - For relational data
- **PostgreSQL** - When I need something more powerful
- **MongoDB** - For those NoSQL moments
- **Redis** - Because caching is everything

### Testing
I believe in writing solid tests, so I use:
- **Jest** - My testing framework of choice
- **Mocha** - When the project calls for it

## My Setup

I'm rocking a **MacBook Pro 16'' Mid 2021** with the **Apple M1 Pro** chip. It's a beast, and it handles everything I throw at it. I'm running **macOS** and doing most of my browsing in **Safari**.
